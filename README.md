# ifo_Forecast_evaluation
Project Repository for my work at ifo macroeconomics and surveys, evaluating the performance of prior forecasts against alternaitve providers and approaches.

Currently, there is only one file available: Naive Forecaster, which creates naive forecasts based on simple averages, simple mocing averages or AR models, where a number of parameters may be customized. You can find some explanations in the header of the code.
Future developments will conduct extensive evaluation of ifo's and possibly other's past forecast performance against these more naive methods
